| Tool | Benefit |Drawback
|--|--|--|
|Dependabot  | Built into Github, Configurable alerts, Sends pull requests to update dependencies.|Only for Use On Github. Might want a more managed solution with vulnerability scanning.
Snyk|Is a full security and dependency management platform in one. Has continuous scanning. Seems to have an industry following.|Costs Money at enterprise level. Might be paying for unnecessary features.|
| AutoFAC | May work well for Windows application development, as it looks specialized in that area. |Is only for .NET development, and Windows applications.
|FOSSA|Emphasis on Open Source Software license tracking, as well as dependency tracking and vulnerability scanning. | May have features not needed for use case. Also a paid solution at enterprise level.
|Doppins| Free for open source projects, looks relativity simple. | Only for JavaScript and Python, will not work in many use cases.
|Gemnasium| Seems similar in scope to Depandabot, open source and free. | Only for use on GitLab.
